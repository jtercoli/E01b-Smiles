# E01b-Smiles
Using Python Arcade, a graphics library we installed via pip, I was able to adjust x and y coordinates in order to move shapes on the screen. On main2.py and main3.py, we examined how using the offset of each shape in relation to one-another can assist in placing said shapes. In main4.py we had to build one face, so that it may repeat from x to y, in intervals of z.
